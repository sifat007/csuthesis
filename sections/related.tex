\subsection{Existing algorithms for solving 0/1-KP}
Because the optimal solution of 0/1-KP has exponential time complexity, there
are two different approaches when trying to solve the problem. First approach
is to find the exact optimal solution which in worst case will always have
exponential time complexity. And the second approach is to find approximate
solutions that have significantly less time-complexity but will not find the
optimal solution every time. Depending on the real-world problem requirements
either type of solution can be used.

Among the exact optimal solutions Dynamic Programming(DP) and
Branch-and-Bound(BB) solutions are widely known.
