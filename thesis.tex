% Abstract
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\abstract{%
  The 0/1-Knapsack Problem (KP) is a classic NP-hard problem, with two common
  approaches for solving it exactly: branch-and-bound (BB) and dynamic
  programming (DP).  A so called, ``sparse'' DP algorithm (SKPDP).  We first
  perform a careful empirical evaluation of SKPDP, and observe that for
  ``large enough'' capacity, $C$, the number of operations performed by SKPDP is
  invariant with respect to $C$.  This leads to the possibility of SKPDP
  providing an exponential improvement over the standard DP, comparable to what
  can be achieved by BB algorithms.

  DP algorithms have very regular structure and are amenable to highly parallel
  implementations.  We perform a roofline analysis of the sequential SKPDP, and
  show that it is memory bandwidth bound.  We develop two parallelizations
  (coarse-grain and fine-grain) of SKPDP on modern multicore processors (with
  $P$ cores).  We similarly analyze both parallelizations, and show that the
  coarse-grain version can reduce memory bandwidth requirements by a factor of
  $P$.  We expect the results of our ongoing experiments to validate these analyses.

\acknowledgements{%
I would like to thank the CSU Graduate Student Council and the CSU Graduate School for initiating, commissioning and supporting this project.  I would also like to thank Nicole Ramo for her support and ensuring that we followed through with this project to completion.  I would like to thank Leif Anderson, who created and supported the previous LaTeX template for a number of years.  Although I have never met Leif, his work was invaluable in the creation of this package and has helped many students get their thesis approved by the CSU graduate school.  Finally, I would like to thank everyone who helps to contribute to this package.  Your work will help many CSU graduate students to create professional, beautiful and compelling theses and dissertations using LaTex.  Last but not least, thank you to the creators and maintaners of \LaTeX{} for creating a fantastic typesetting tool.
